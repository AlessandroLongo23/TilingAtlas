# STATUS — TilingAtlas (current-state cache)

> **What this file is.** The 30-second "where are we" snapshot. **Mutable, disposable,

## Knowledge model (read once, then follow it)

Two tiers. Do not mix them.

- **Ledgers — sacred: append-only, never trimmed, ONE writer per file.** The natural-language
  history the thesis (`../../thesis/chapters/journey.tex`) is written from. Rotate to
  `archive/<name>-YYYY-MM.md` when large (rotation loses nothing).
  - `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` — CC's session-by-session narrative (code/algorithm).
  - `../../resources/research/TA_LOG.md` — TA's chronological ledger (theory/proofs); topical
    detail in the sibling `resources/research/*.md` notes.
  - `SYNC.md` — CC⇄TA handoff log. Entries **3–6 lines**: what landed + commit + ledger link.
    Full pre-2026-06 history in `archive/SYNC-2026-06.md`.
- **Cache — this file.** Current state only. Overwrite freely.

## Frontier (2026-06-10 evening)

- ★★ **k ≤ 2 THEOREM-CERTIFIED, oracle-independent** (B1 + canonical augmentation + lem:ddrealize +
  lem:ddrealizer realizer + lem:corona; per-tiling torus match both directions). NOTES §27.
- ★★ **k = 3 RE-CERTIFIED PER-TILING, end-to-end CLOSED** (2026-06-10): the old certified digest
  `eb34499d5fba3457` was per-tiling WRONG (canceling duplicate + missing t3007 — NOTES §28); both
  defects fixed (§29), full no-cap re-sweep 449/449 seeds → **new anchor `99919f42a7b58e76`/61**,
  per-tiling oracle bijection PASSED ×2 (`recert-oracle-match.ts`); DB: old run de-certified, recert
  run `52d0cb2e` certified; figures snapshot/orbits/oracle-map regenerated → **92/92**; k=3 gallery
  FINAL incl. t3007.pdf. NOTES §31. ★ **Stability ×2 PASSED** (fresh sweep reproduced
  `99919f42a7b58e76`/61 byte-identical, 449/449, 0 timeouts —
  `experiments/results/k3-stability-regression-0d6c96b-2026-06-10.log`) — single-run residue closed;
  also the k=3 batch acceptance for the CB landings below.
- ★ **Review batch CB-2/7/8 LANDED, digest-neutral** (k≤2 byte-identical post-merge, `b81e823`):
  CB-2 Surd.sign provable error-bound filter (`216302b` — the fuzz test found a REAL wrong-sign at
  coefficient height ~2⁵⁶: the old 1e-6 gate was unsound in fact, not just in principle; NOTES §30);
  CB-7 primitivity-rejection guard + CB-8 tuned-pool regime banner/reach counting (`eefa6ac`,
  diagnostics-only; NOTES §32). **§32.2 Finding 2 SIGNED OFF by TA 2026-06-10** (sound; see
  `../resources/research/cb7-finding2-signoff-2026-06-10.md`); **all 3 sign-off asks LANDED** on
  `fix/cb7-finding2-followups` @ `d433b95` (counter + loud star-ladder truncation + docstring;
  NOTES §33) — **MERGED `9674c95`** after k≤2 probe re-check byte-identical on d433b95
  (`cb7-followups-probes-d433b95-2026-06-10.log`). (CB-9 push ✓ 2026-06-10.)
- ★ **Review batch CB-5/CB-4/CB-6 LANDED on `fix/cb5-cb4-cb6` @ `74e03a9` — ALL CB items now
  closed** (NOTES §35): CB-5 N≠24 throw (`983b8e3`); CB-4 always-on equivalence guard + standing
  import-disjoint congruence differential wired into the recert harness (`942da53`); CB-6 cull
  R_P+maxCircum (`46b0f79`). **The CB-4 guard fired on first contact with the k=3 artifact** —
  `reducedClassKey`'s float-window reduction was NOT class-canonical on skewed bases (direction-
  dependent false negatives; completeness, never soundness; certified 61 unaffected — lucky third
  rep). Fixed exact (`c802989`). Acceptance: k≤2 probes byte-identical ×2, suite 327/327, recert
  ★ PASS 61/61 + differential 0/2131 mismatches (`cb456-probes-*`, `k3-recert-...-18-22.log`).
  ⚑ Outstanding: fresh k=3 no-cap sweep (expect `99919f42a7b58e76`/61) as batch acceptance; merge
  on AL's go. ⚑ TA: thesis §19.6 congruence narrative gains the §35 sibling caveat.
- **DG-1 verdict stands:** proven-config lattice run INFEASIBLE even at k=1 (≈1,370 yr) ⇒ thesis
  honest-rewrite (TX option (b)) merged; the measurement is itself a thesis result. NOTES §25.
- Orbifold: correct-but-gated (NOTES §23.9). Star: 4(j) spike certified k=1 exact; ST-1 conventions
  CLOSED in thesis master. Seed-anchored D-D dead by mechanism (NOTES §26).
- ★ **ST-2 + ST-3(1+3) + ST-9 LANDED** (2026-06-10, `feat/st-star-work-orders` @ `a99e61b`, NOT merged,
  digest-neutral): Myers-2009 k=2 oracle (43 records, 34 in-ring, pins 36/40/42; ⚑ TA caption
  spot-check pending); productive star-fill positively covered via 4(i) + mutation check; honest
  run-matrix + §24 retitle + per-cause truncation summary. ⚑ NEW finding: **4(i) is measured OUTSIDE
  the tuned pool ⇒ the tuned dentreg sweep's ceiling is 12/13 Fig-4 tilings** (the §24.7
  demonstration run can never be 13/13 without Increment-3 pool work). NOTES §35.
- Orbifold: correct-but-gated (NOTES §23.9). Star: 4(j) spike certified k=1 exact; ST-1 closed +
  TH-3 star theory landed (TA); ★ **CC star tables LANDED 2026-06-10** (`feat/th4-th13-star-tables`
  @ `7813ce8`, NOTES §35): TH-4 d_max(envelope) = 9 exact ⇒ δ ≤ 18k, F ≤ 42k; TH-13 19/8/5 +
  single-variant regular-filler rider — constants INPUT, discharge is TA's. Seed-anchored D-D dead
  by mechanism (NOTES §26).

## Thesis state

- **Thesis master = `7d76b58`** (ff-merged 2026-06-10 late, AL-directed; 85pp clean post-merge,
  0 undefined refs). Contains, as scoped commits: TH-1 octagon lemma (`8595b7d`), results
  restructure + prose swap (`ece66b0`), ST-1 star conventions closed (`cefccc6`), TH-9
  lem:orbitdedup (`ae61853`), D-D bound closed — lem:flagsharp δ≤12k−2 tight (`efe6d6c`), TH-3
  star quotient repair (`7d76b58`). Resources ledger at `9b0638e` (incl. the exact-δ script/data
  for the certified 92). Detail: TA_LOG (2026-06-10).
- **TH-2/C1-Part-B DISCHARGED** (2026-06-10 late): fill completeness is a lemma, not an assumption
  — `lem:fillreach` + `rem:fillreach`, prop:fanseed restated; branch `th2-fillreach-2026-06-10` @
  `8c0a39d` (87pp clean, 0 undefined refs), pending AL review/merge. Resources at `24451c0`.
  ✓ Both CC work orders from the audit LANDED (`c8bc258`, NOTES §34): buildBlock `min(60,·)` index
  cap asserted per candidate (⚑ + `diag.blockIndexCapTruncated`; sweeps must assert 0) and
  maxCellPolys default = max(20k+24, 24k); k≤2 probes byte-identical, F3 flags silent on the
  certified record. Detail: `../../resources/research/fill-completeness-lemma-TH2-2026-06-10.md`.

## Repo state (re-verify on read — this section goes stale fastest)

- **master = ff of `fix/cb5-cb4-cb6` post-merge (merge commit `7d3813a` = `c8bc258` TH-2 F3 ⋈
  CB-5/4/6+§35; AL-directed 2026-06-10 night). Post-merge acceptance: k=1 `6f9ca9cf2d16c75f`/11 ✓,
  k=2 `f3e2e0517191362c`/20 ✓ 0 timeouts (first k=2 run showed cap-jitter under the other
  session's load — 2 seeds hit the 120s default cap; re-run maxMs=600000 byte-identical;
  `cb456-postmerge-probes-7d3813a-*.log`), suite 331/331 (5 load-timeouts pass isolated)**.
  Branches pushed to origin (CB-9 ✓).
- **master = `0291e83`** (TH-2 F3 + docs; not yet pushed, 5 ahead of origin). Open branches:
  `feat/st-star-work-orders` @ `a99e61b` (ST-2/3/9, this session — merge held) and the other
  session's `fix/cb5-cb4-cb6` @ `5a5367d` (⚑ carries its OWN §34 — renumber at merge; solver edits
  may conflict with the ST-9 poolConfig change). Accepted k=3 artifact at
  `.scout-cache/k3-accepted-99919f42a7b58e76.ndjson`; the live cache holds the stability sweep's
  identical artifact. ⚑ Old k=3 resume caches INVALID (seed indices shifted) — always fresh.
- Review work-orders: `docs/review-2026-06-09/` (01 code items ALL closed; OP/ST files untouched).
- Supabase: k=3 run `52d0cb2e` certified (61); old `d522b481` de-certified, rows retained.
